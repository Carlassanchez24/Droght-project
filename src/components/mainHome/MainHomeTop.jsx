            Drought is a common phenomenon in the Iberian Peninsula due to its geographical location. We have suffered and will continue to suffer from climate-induced droughts for thousands of years, but something is changing along the way. Due to climate change, dry seasons are expected to be more intense and longer. In addition to this, the use and consumption of water is increasing, presenting real scenarios of water scarcity and hydrological drought.
            The IPCC predicts that Mediterranean countries like ours will experience rising temperatures and declining rainfall in the coming decades. According to the World Meteorological Organization, global temperatures have already risen 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times and 0.2 degrees Celsius between 2011 and 2015. Less rain and a warmer climate increase water evaporation, reducing water availability . In addition, the climate crisis increases the risk of large-scale forest fires (which will increase by 50% between now and 2100, according to the United Nations) and worsens the desertification process.
            The worsening of the drought is worrying as it affects the economy and the population. But we must not forget the environmental impact of water scarcity, especially taking into account the increased risk of desertification that climate change exposes us to.</p
